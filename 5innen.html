        5INNEN
The core idea of 5innen was to create a place where all artforms could meet. 
We debuted this concept the summer 2021 by arranging a one-day festival called 5innen - derived from the Swedish word ’Sinnen’ - meaning senses - and the ’5’ standing for all of them.

The festival took place in and outside an amphitheater in a park called Vitabergsparken in Stockholm. The day was a taste of what’s to come. With a line-up of different up & coming and/or underground artists from various genres that performed in the amphitheater throughout the day. 
On the hill behind the theater there were tents placed in a circle with a gazebo in the middle. In the tents there were various designers that sold clothes and merchandise from their brand and in the other half culinary artists from different cultures sold food. The gazebo in the middle acted as a gallery. There hung painting from two Stockholm-based artist. It was an experience for all five senses. 

Thereafter we arranged a set of events of all kinds. It could be everything from smaller gigs to release parties and shows but even art exhibitions and runways. - the point was to give the creative a platform, which we succeeded in doing to be said the least. 

Since then 5innen has been formed into a concept house and works to portray, rebrand, market creators and their art by arranging an event where we handle the production from start to finish. We don’t make any money on the artist but through financing from collaborations and sponsors.

My role in 5innen has been wide due to me being one of the two founders. With everything from coming up with a fitting concept, creating the idea of the brand with a clear identity and logo, leading projects, administration, logistics and bureaucracy.  I have acted as CD/AD completely or partially in all projects. The role has also entailed handling all communication in-house between our associates but also externally towards partners, sponsors, guests and potential prospects. 

The reason this idea was created is simple. We saw a problem that has affected not just Sweden, but much of the Western world— which was mental health issues. By chance, both my collaborator and I had accumulated quite a bit of research on how to not only prevent but also actively counteract this problem. This can be briefly summarized by the well-known (or perhaps not so well-known) saying: “The opposite of depression is expression.” With this in mind, we created 5innen — not only to give creators a platform to stand on and express themselves, but also to inspire visitors to do the same.

As for the logo mark, the inspiration comes from the Eye of Horus. Initially, the idea was to reference the symbol directly, but instead using a 5 in place of the usual ornamental detail. The Eye of Horus is the symbol of the mind, which the ancient Egyptians believed to be the place where everything begins and ends. It is through the mind that we bring things from the world of thoughts into reality, which aligns perfectly with 5innen’s motto: “We create the world we want to live in.”
So the logo serves both to inspire and to remind us that everything we see—everything created by humans—starts in the same place: the mind.
